## üîß Coding Approach

### 1. Shopify Theme Section
We created a new custom snippts named `pincode-validator.liquid`, which includes:

- A basic HTML structure: an input field, a button, and a result container.
- A script that uses `axios` to call the Google Sheets API.
- Basic validation and conditional logic based on pincode availability.

### 2. Google Sheets as Data Source
- All deliverable pincodes are stored in **Column A** of a public Google Sheet.
- The sheet is **published to the web** for public read-only access.
- The **Google Sheets API** is used to fetch the data.

### 3. API Key and URL Structure
The frontend script hits the following URL:

### 4. Create a block in `main-product.liquid`, and call block to on product page please refer the below code 

//block code 
{
      "type": "pincode_Checker",
      "name": "pincode_Checker",
      "settings": [
      ]
    }, 

//render code 

{%- when 'pincode_Checker'-%}
                {% render 'pincode-validator' %}

### 5. test login 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/YOUR_SHEET_ID/values/Sheet1!A:A?key=YOUR_API_KEY 

- `YOUR_SHEET_ID` = from the Google Sheet URL
- `Sheet1` = your tab name
- `YOUR_API_KEY` = generated from Google Cloud Console

### 4. JavaScript Logic
- User enters a pincode ‚Üí clicks "Check Availability"
- Script fetches all pincodes from the Google Sheet
- If the entered pincode exists in the list ‚Üí show ‚úÖ Delivery Available
- Else ‚Üí show ‚ùå Delivery Not Available

### 5. Optional Security
- The API key can be restricted to work only from your Shopify domain.
- You may create a proxy via Google Apps Script for a secure setup if needed.
